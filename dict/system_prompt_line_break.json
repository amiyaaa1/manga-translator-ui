  "line_break_prompt": "CRITICAL RULE: When you need to break a line for readability or fit, you MUST insert the special symbol `[BR]` at that exact position. Do not use `\n` or actual newlines in your output. For example, if you want to translate 'Hello World' into two lines, your output must be 'Hello[BR]World'."
